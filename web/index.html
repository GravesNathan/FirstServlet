Interestingly with the example below I can see that the href calls for
the processRequest of MyServlet while the post form calls for the doPost.
Regardless of which map or page I refer to that much is consistent.
I'm sure the same would be said of doGet etc.

I wonder though, how would I specify that one doPost responds with A while
another doPost responds with B?  I can only think of having multiple MyServlet
classes maybe?  or is there a better way...?  Unless the web.xml mapping is the key...
But the web.xml only seems to control what request is mapped to what servlet.
It does not include code (to my knowledge of how to respond.

At least for now.  I think a single servlet would work fine if the behavior of the response
is the same across request, perhaps in the process request one where you just
link to the other url.  However for forms and customized webpages that change based on the
initial request...can a single servlet do that.  The whole request process only creates an instance
of the servlet class which handles the request ( think).

Lets experiment and see where this takes us...Maybe one servlet can be made to have
unique doPost/doGet functions based on the input or soemthing like that.  Or else inside
the doPost, etc, functions it can use if statements to check for what is being asked.
Maybe then a hashmap or similar (for larger applications) can control the type of
response the client receives
